    "## *Object Oriented Programing:*\n",
    "#### Object Oriented Programing (OOP) is a paradigm in which real-world objects are each viewed as separate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Benefits of OOP:*\n",
    "##### 1. We can reused codes easily due to class is sharable.\n",
    "##### 2.Fleibility through polymorphism.\n",
    "##### 3.The productivity of programming increases.\n",
    "##### 4.The programming gets easy and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Differentiate B/w Function and Method:*\n",
    "##### Method is called on an object, unlike a function. Since we call a method on an object, it can access the data within it. A method may alter an object's state, but Function usually only operates on it, and then prints something or returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Class:*\n",
    "##### It is a template or blue print about the capability of what an object can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Object:*\n",
    "##### An object (instance) ia an instantation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Attribute:*\n",
    "##### Attribute are the properties of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Behaviour:*\n",
    "##### The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure.\n"
